          <h2>On Technology & Innovation</h2>
          <p>I believe technology should serve humanity, not the other way around. The most impactful innovations come from understanding real problems and building solutions that genuinely improve people's lives.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Blockchain technology</strong> represent more of autonomity to me over a censored control entity but at the same time i feel alot of project or tech build are stash up liquitidy sucking schemes or in general trying to figure out one problem but at the same time one or the other trying to fix again the version of the other co-existence.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AI views</strong> fascinates me, But I'm cautious about the direction we're heading. We need to ensure AI remains a tool that amplifies human, i used ai for my daily purpose at an extend but if you asked me for agi i don't think we are there yet.</p>

        <div class="view-section">
          <h2>On Work & Life Balance</h2>
          <p>I sleep 99% later than most of the world, and I'm okay with that. Productivity isn't about following someone else's schedule it's about finding your own rhythm and working when you're most creative and focused.</p>
          
          <p>Growing up in Imphal, taught me the value of community and taking time to appreciate the simple things. Small towns have a way of keeping you grounded.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="view-section">
          <h2>On Learning & Growth</h2>
          <p>Every project is a learning opportunity. Whether it's building <a href="https://super-censored-again-potato-phi.vercel.app" target="_blank">UpFloor</a> or exploring crypto markets, I approach everything with curiosity and a willingness to fail fast and learn faster.</p>
          
          <p>The more often i try to solve my ideas. I try to stay open to inspiration from different fields sometimes the solution to a technical problem comes from understanding psychology, economics, or even philosophy.I prefer building something that has impact me individually or help part of a system better</p>
        </div>

        <div class="view-section">
          <h2>On the Future</h2>
          <p>We're living in an exciting time where the boundaries between physical and digital worlds are blurring. The next decade will be defined by how well we can integrate these technologies into our daily lives without losing what makes us human.</p>
          
          <p>I'm optimistic about the potential for technology we're building.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="view-section" id="community-section">
          <h2>On Community & Connection</h2>
          <p>Despite working in technology, I value human connection above all. The best projects are built by teams that trust each other, and the best solutions come from understanding the people who will use them.</p>
          
          <p>isolation has been part of my life and has been going through alot of people would judge me based on my existence vs the social life.</p>
          <p> and this has maybe impacted alot of my social culture and lifestyle from losing good friends and culture not because i want them to go away</p>
          <p> people hardly try to understand what and how it goes for me, and this has maybe impacted a lot of my social culture and lifestyle from losing good friends and culture not because I want them to go away</p>
        <p> i void praising people or favoring them beause i have to achieve or gain something from them my last experience lately</p>
      <p> above all the note the i have high resilence over anything that is extremely hard to work on and end up figuring most of the time</p>
