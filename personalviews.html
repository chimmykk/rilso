          <h2>On Technology & Innovation</h2>
          <p>Tech should help people, not the other way around. The best stuff I've built comes from actually understanding what problems people have.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Blockchain</strong> means freedom from control to me, but honestly a lot of projects are just money grabs. Everyone's trying to solve the same problems in slightly different ways.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AI</strong> is cool but I'm careful about where it's going. I use it daily but we're nowhere near AGI yet. It should help humans, not replace us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="view-section">
          <h2>On Work & Life Balance</h2>
          <p>I sleep way later than most people and that's fine. Being productive isn't about following someone else's schedule - it's about working when you're actually focused.</p>
          
          <p>Growing up in Imphal taught me about community and appreciating simple things. Small towns keep you real.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="view-section">
          <h2>On Learning & Growth</h2>
          <p>Every project teaches me something. Whether it's about me currently building <a href="https://super-censored-again-potato-phi.vercel.app" target="_blank">UpFloor</a> or checking out crypto, I'm cool with failing fast and learning.</p>
          
          <p>I try to stay open to ideas from different fields. Sometimes the solution to a tech problem comes from psychology or economics. I like building stuff that actually helps me or makes a system work better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="view-section">
          <h2>On the Future</h2>
          <p>We're in a weird time where real and digital worlds are mixing. The next 10 years will be about using tech without losing what makes us human.</p>
          
          <p>I'm hopeful about the tech we're building.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="view-section" id="community-section">
          <h2>On Community & Connection</h2>
          <p>Even though I work in tech, human connection matters most. The best projects come from teams that trust each other and understand their users.</p>
          
          <p>Isolation has been a big part of my life. A lot of people judge me based on how I live versus what they think social life should be.</p>
          <p>This has affected my relationships and lifestyle  I have lost good friends and connections, not because I wanted them to go away.</p>
          <p>People rarely try to understand what it's actually like for me. They see my choices and make assumptions without asking.</p>
          <p>I avoid praising or favoring people just to get something from them. Been burned by that too many times.</p>
          <p>But I have high resilience. When something is really hard to work on, I usually figure it out eventually.</p>
